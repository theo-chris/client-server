# Instructions
1. Run DSAKeyGen twice. Once for the fixed "server" and once with a <userid> which can be whatever you want. This will generate the keys to be used.
2. Rename the txt file to match the same <userid> selected in step 1. You can edit the contents of the txt file if you wish.
3. Run the server and then the client.
